# DiscordSelfbot
A discord raid/utility selfbot coded in python. This is a rewrite of my old selfbot, DiscordUtils.

**Before running make sure to fill out the info at the top of the code (token and prefix)**

# Setting prefix and token
Your token is how the bot will connect to your account. You'll have to paste it in the quotations. For help getting your token, click [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI1lzqzLQCs&t=2s)

*Example:*
```py
token = "Njyyauush7445abd-==y.iiaji.87hd-mnjdfjjb=djnjhhsf"
```

The prefix will also need to be placed in the quotations. This is how the bot knows you're running a command.

*Example:*
```py
prefix = "&"
```

# Commands
Commands are as follows:

> help: Shows a full list of commands.
> 
> chanclear: Purges your messages in the command channel.
> 
> msgedit: Edits all you messages in a channel.
>
> userinfo: Gets the info of all users mentioned after the command and sends in chat as a text file.
> 
> spam: Spams a message in chat.Your token is how the bot will connect to your account. You'll have to paste it in the quotations.
> 
> gspam: Ghost spams messages in chat.
> 
> rspam: Ghost spams a list of all roles.
> 
> nuke: Nukes the server.
>
> logout: Logs out of the client.

All commands will use your prefix before the actual command (e.g. &logout). Make sure to check back for any updates, I'm going to try to update this every once in a while.

# *Enjoy!*
